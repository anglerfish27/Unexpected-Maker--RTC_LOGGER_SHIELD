SD-Card Reader code and I2C STEMMA usage code for the 'Unexpected Maker RTC Logger Shield for TinyPico and TinyS2/S3'
This code has the pin configurate for the TinyS3, different models may require different pin configurations.
See the pinout card that you recieved when you purchased your device.
This code example has been modified from the IO Expander module SD card example from Unexpected Maker.
My portions of the code can be copied/modified and used in any fashion you desire.
This is really geared for more beginners at MP. It helps me (as a beginner) and I hope it helps someone else too!
I include 2 version of the file, one labeled verbose which has a lot of comments in it (functional). Then I have a second one that has much less comments (functional). 
You may do as you wish with my portions of the code. However you must abide by Unexpected Maker's Acceptible use policies. I am not affiliated with Unexpected maker in ANY way and this is just a private individual's code cobbled together from some of UM's code as well.
